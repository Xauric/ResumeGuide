# Missingno's Guide to Making Resumes That Don't Suck (Most of the time)
A simple, no-nonsense guide for making resumes for job hunting in information security.

So, you're currently hunting for your first information security job. 

I'm not claiming to be an expert by *any* means on this. But I've done the job hunting thing long enough, and have hired people at other organizations long enough, to know what looks good and what doesn't. 
Keep in mind, this is just my personal experience. I do not claim any responsibility for you getting or not getting interviews or jobs with what you do with the information here. 

# So, where do I start?
The first thing you want to do with your resume is remember what it's trying to accomplish. Remember, your resume should be your wingman. It's the thing that shows off just how great of a person you are. 

# The first part of your resume: The Contact Information
The first thing your resume should include should be:
- The name you prefer to be addressed by
- Your phone number (You'll also want to make sure your voicemail is professional)
- A professional email (Not "dickmuncher69@gmail.com". Make an email with your first and last name specifically for job hunting.)
- And any links to websites that showcase your working history, such as github/gitlab and Linkedin. (More on this later)

Conversely, your resume should *not* have:
- Your geographical location. Unless you're applying to local jobs, having your location on a resume will more often be used as a reason to disqualify you.
- Any social media that isn't strictly work related. This means Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, everything that might be used for personal use.

You want to make yourself as memorable as possible, and you want to make getting a hold of you as easy as possible. Make sure you have your phone on you, and promptly get back to anyone who contacts you. This should constitute no more than 1/5th of your total resume. 

# The second part: Your professional summary
Your professional summary is the tl;dr of who you are. It should be:
- Who you are
- What you're doing
- What you *want* to do

However, there's more to this than just writing yourself like a paragraph of technical summation. You want to make it personal! Communicate *who you are*. Remember, resumes (and job hunting as a whole) is considered as much a *personality fit* as it is a *technical fit*. 

For example, this is the one that I have in my resume:
"Hi! I’m Missingno, I’m an Information Security professional with almost a decade’s worth of experience in the industry, a passion for Red and Blue Team Operations, and a specialization in vulnerability management, incident response, and penetration testing. I’m looking to advance my career in a senior-level Security Engineering position, to further my career and skills in a highly involved and technical position, and help mentor junior IT and Information Security professionals."

Be willing to be yourself! 

# The third part: Your qualifications

Are you currently a student, or otherwise attended college? Do you have any certifications? 

As a note: You should *not* list certifications you *plan on* taking. 

# So what if I don't have any technical experience and want to gain it?

# Okay, but I don't *have* any experience. What do I do?
Here's one of the biggest things I had to learn when I first started out:
**When companies say they want 3-5 years experience for an entry level job, they aren't necessarily talking about professional experience.**

Information security is unique as a field of science. If I were working help desk, and I tried to apply for something like a Database Administrator job, I might have some experience that translates over, but by and large I likely will have a lot I'll need to learn to be proficient at the job. Chances are, someone who's currently working a Database-adjacent job will have a better chance of scoring an interview than I will. There are plenty of fields in IT where skills don't necessarily transfer.

But infosec is different, because **everything in an organization is involved in infosec, with zero exceptions.**

Are you working in help desk? That's just about the most valuable experience you could be gaining to pivot into infosec. 
Are you a software developer? Guess what, a lot of people don't know how to code securely. 
Are you a lawyer or legal-adjacent? GRC is an entire field dedicated to Governance, Regulation, and Compliance. (GRC also stands for Governance Risk Management and Compliance but just roll with me here)

Well that's nice, but what if you aren't in IT at all?

Are you client-facing? Do you have a phone support job? Maybe you work at a restaurant or a call center, or maybe you do blue collar work. You'll be surprised to hear this, but a lot of the skills I use in infosec I didn't gain from my career in IT, but rather my time working Geek Squad as a help desk jockey, helping grandmas figure out how to turn on their computer. Several of those soft skills, such as **escalation and expectation management, solutions research, and service level agreement management** are extremely valuable in infosec, particularly in jobs where you have clients like at an MSSP (Managed Security Services Provider).

My point is: **There is no such thing as irrelevant experience in infosec.** I've worked with all number of people from different backgrounds, from people who were private investigators and special agents with the FBI, to janitors of 20 years and dental assistants. 

The great thing about IT as a field of science is that it's completely man-made. If I wanted to be a nuclear physicist, I couldn't go out to Amazon or Walmart and buy the same tools that they use. But I sure can for the tools that infosec professionals use on the daily. 

There are plenty of websites and resources out there that are very affordable, or outright free, to be able to learn the beginner skills necessary to get into IT and infosec. 

For Red and Blue Team Operations, I recommend:
- [TryHackMe](https://www.tryhackme.com/) - A gamified platform to help teach everything from pentesting to vulnerability management to incident response through hands-on training.
- [HackTheBox Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/) - Similar to TryHackMe, but with a significantly deeper amount of knowledge related to pentesting and bug bounties.
- [HackTheBox Labs](https://app.hackthebox.com) - The sister "site" to HackTheBox Academy, this features remote machines that you try to hack into, utilizing the knowledge you gain from HTB academy.
